So, it's the year 3000, and a while ago, like a hundred years back, a comet fell, and gave almost every single person powers, which can be defined by the radiant colors of the eyes. So some guy comes a long, really exctided to est for his powers, because they only awaken at age 14-15. so he comes and nothing shows up, so he thinks that he doesn't have powers. he actually does though, he has a rare power which maikes his eyes glow purple.

So someone pulls him away later, and reveals he is the teacher of the empowered students. And the kid is lke, " why me? I don't have anything!" And then the sensei takes out his own power, which is a ball of fire. And the kid is like, " Woah, I wish I could do that." And then his hands busrt into flame. And so apparently he can steal other peoples powers. And then it's revealed that another guy, who is the bad guy, is rich, and is collecting slaves with powers, so he's after the purple glow kid.
